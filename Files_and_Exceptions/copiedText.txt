Now that you’ve mastered the basic skillsyou need to write organized programsthat are easy to use, it’s time to think aboutmaking your programs even more relevant andusable. In this chapter you’ll learn to work with filesso your programs can quickly analyze lots of data.You’ll learn to handle errors so your programs don’t crash when theyencounter unexpected situations. You’ll learn about exceptions, which arespecial objects Python creates to manage errors that arise while a programis running. You’ll also learn about the json module, which allows you to saveuser data so it isn’t lost when your program stops running.Learning to work with files and save data will make your programseasier for people to use. Users will be able to choose what data to enter andwhen to enter it. People can run your program, do some work, and thenclose the program and pick up where they left off later. Learning to handleexceptions will help you deal with situations in which files don’t exist anddeal with other problems that can cause your programs to crash. This willmake your programs more robust when they encounter bad data, whether190 Chapter 10it comes from innocent mistakes or from malicious attempts to break yourprograms. With the skills you’ll learn in this chapter, you’ll make your pro-grams more applicable, usable, and stable.
